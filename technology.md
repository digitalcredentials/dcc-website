## Our Technology
We are exploring how recent advances credential data standards and cryptographically signed credentials can be used to rethink the way we recognize and transact with academic achievements.

Building on earlier efforts by the participating institutions, we are now setting our sights on the design and governance of a technology infrastructure for academic credentials â€“ transforming credentials into tokens of social and human capital that can create new opportunities for participation in education and industry. Our Technology Working Group is currently developing a white paper.

## As a learner, this technology will allow you to:
* Maintain a compelling and verifiable record of your lifelong learning achievements to share with employers
* Receive your credentials digitally and safely
* Own all of your credentials forever without having to ask/pay your institution for a transcript ever again
* Compile and curate credentials you receive from multiple educational institutions

## For institutions, digital verifiable credentials enable you to:
* Keep and distribute learner records in a way that is easy, safe, and inexpensive
* Remove the risk of identity fraud
* Issue multiple credentials to a single learner easily, using the same streamlined process
