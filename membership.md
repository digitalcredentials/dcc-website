## We invite you to get involved!

The Digital Credentials Consortium is committed to key values of learner agency, institutional autonomy and openness. We’ve designed our member offerings to provide value to the community at large while providing institutional members the focused support that they need.

The DCC does much of its technical work through open standards organizations including the World Wide Web Consortium’s [Verifiable Credentials for Education (VC-EDU) Task Force](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/) and through our [open source software](https://github.com/digitalcredentials). DCC members support this broad technical work for the benefits of higher education and post-graduate institutions globally. 

DCC members focus on collaborative projects and individual institutional priorities leveraging the consortium's technical leadership and expertise.

Joining the Digital Credentials Consortium begins with a conversation, please email us at <a href="mailto:dcc-membership-inquiry@mit.edu">dcc-membership-inquiry@mit.edu</a>.
