**Purpose and scope of the registry**

The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) Member Registry is a list of members and the decentralized identity(ies) that they use to digitally sign their W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and those credentials aligned with VCs like Open Badges 3.0.

Verifiers of these digital credentials can seek information about the DCC members using the decentralized identifier (DID) located in the credential.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Subject matter focus of the registry: Limited to issuers, potentially specific types of issuers**

The purpose of this registry is to store information about issuers who are or who have been members of the DCC and are or have issued Verifiable Credentials. I

The DCC is a consortium of post-secondary institutions who issue digital degrees, micro-credentials, certificates, and other education-related or work-related VCs.

Information about issuers, including their DID, is added by DCC Support Staff once membership is confirmed  and their DID is authenticated.

**Organization: Organizational mission**

The Digital Credentials Consortium’s mission is to advance the use and understanding of privacy-enhanced, portable, verifiable digital credentials in higher education through open source technology development and leadership, research and advocacy.
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Governing body or advisory board structure: Composition and roles**

The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) Member Registry is under the purview of the DCC Members by-laws. This registry will only contain DIDs and issuer identity information pertaining to DCC members. The DCC is operated under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which employs the DCC staff and serves as the administrative center for the Consortium.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Governing body or advisory board structure: Processes for decision-making and resolving disputes**

The DCC Member Registry is managed by the DCC support staff. This includes: 
- oversight of operations, policies, and procedures, 
- periodic review of registry performance and standards,
- communication and transparency policies for governance decisions,
- protocols for handling conflicts or challenges related to registry governance,
- and regular updates to stakeholders on registry changes and improvements.
  
The DCC membership is governed by a Leadership Council which provides input on the strategic direction of the Consortium. Leadership Council members follow a set of bylaws set by collective agreement. 

DCC membership offers two tiers, Member and Core Member. The fee for membership is respectively $5000.00 and $20,000.00 per year with a commitment to a three year contract. 

Members can be included in DCC member registries, participate in working groups, meetings and events, and can vote to elect Leadership Council members. 

Core Members are entitled to all Member benefits. Additionally, they can nominate a member for the Leadership Council and receive priority technical support from DCC developers. 
In order to be eligible for membership, prospects must represent a non-profit or state funded postsecondary education institution. Prospective members must submit a letter of interest for approval by the Leadership Council. Once approved, the institution will enter into an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which employs the DCC staff and serves as the administrative center for the Consortium.

Mandatory data (will be used internally and not displayed publicly): Main contact point email

Optional: CTID, ROR
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Process for verifying issuer identity and legitimacy: Know Your Customer (KYC) process/other identification process**

Any communications will be confirmed by the issuer registry with the main contact point email. To join the registry, potential issuers must send a sample credential signed with their DID.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Process for verifying issuer identity and legitimacy: Use of third-party services (if any)**

No third-party services used.
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Process for reviewing and maintaining issuer information: Initial verification steps and estimated processing time**

For an issuer to join, they contact the DCC with a letter of intent, agree to contract terms, and pay membership fees. . Entry reviews will occur on a rolling basis when an issuer requests to join the registry. The issuer must provide information as specified above. Processing time for new members is not measured.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Process for reviewing and maintaining issuer information: Frequency and criteria for periodic reviews and estimated processing time**

The issuer registry will be updated on a rolling (as-needed) basis. If an issuer updates their information and sends it to the issuer registry maintainers, such change shall be shown in the registry within an estimated timeframe of 7 days. A yearly check will be conducted to confirm the accuracy of the issuer data (the registry maintainers will contact the issuer and confirm that the data is up-to-date). If any anomalies are found as a part of the yearly checks, the issuer will be required to update their data within 30 days. Otherwise, the issuer data can remain the same from year to year.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Issuer planned/emergency key rotation and/or key compromise policies (including response, audit, and notification policies)**

DID methods are used as identifying criteria. For DID:web type issuers, any changes in the signing key are the responsibility of the issuer. For DID:key type issuers, if an issuer changes their signing key voluntarily or involuntarily, the old DID:key will be removed from the registry. No notification will be provided or posted if issuers change their signing key and no audits will be performed.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Retention and archival policies: longevity of issuer data for long-term verification**

There are no archival processes for issuers who participate in the registry. The registry is designed to operate in perpetuity; if the registry is shut down, efforts will be made to (a) first transfer the registry to another maintainer, and (b) if another suitable maintainer cannot be found, to archive the registry in a tamper-evident file format and host this file externally.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Policies for organizations that close, merge, or leave the registry**

If an issuer leaves the registry or closes, their information will be removed. If an issuer is merged with another issuer, it will be the responsibility of those issuers to update their signing keys and other information.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Good-faith policies for payment defaults or non-renewal**

If an issuer fails to make the required payments as a DCC member, they will have a period of 30 days to remedy payment delays. At the expiration of this period, the issuer may be removed from the issuer registry at the discretion of the support team.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-12"  markdown="1">

**Policies for issuer removal: Voluntary exit or non-compliance**

If an issuer does not meet required criteria, the issuer will be required to update their data within 30  days. Issuers may also voluntarily remove themselves from the registry within this time period. At the expiration of this time period, issuers will be removed from the registry by the support team.
