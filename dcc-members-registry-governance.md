#### Purpose and scope of the registry

The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) Member Registry is a list of members and the decentralized identity(ies) that they use to digitally sign their W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and those credentials aligned with VCs like Open Badges 3.0.

Verifiers of these digital credentials can seek information about the DCC members using the decentralized identifier (DID) located in the credential.
