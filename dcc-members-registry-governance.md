**Purpose and scope of the registry**

The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) Member Registry is a list of members and the decentralized identity(ies) that they use to digitally sign their W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and those credentials aligned with VCs like Open Badges 3.0.

Verifiers of these digital credentials can seek information about the DCC members using the decentralized identifier (DID) located in the credential.

**Subject matter focus of the registry: Limited to issuers, potentially specific types of issuers.**

The purpose of this registry is to store information about issuers who are or who have been members of the DCC and are or have issued Verifiable Credentials. I

The DCC is a consortium of post-secondary institutions who issue digital degrees, micro-credentials, certificates, and other education-related or work-related VCs.

Information about issuers, including their DID, is added by DCC Support Staff once membership is confirmed  and their DID is authenticated.
