  - name: Kayode Ezike
    title: Software Engineer
    bio: My name is <b>Kayode Ezike</b>, but you can call me Ayo. I was born to two Nigerian Igbo immigrants in New York, where I have lived for most of my life, outside of school. When it was time for college, I shifted my focus to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science before specializing as a graduate student in system design and application development in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Much of my work these days focuses on technologies that enable users to leverage their personal data for access to new opportunities. Outside of the DCC, this work happens primarily at Gobekli and other partner organizations that I am privileged to support. When I am not working, I enjoy singing, writing, lifting, and playing basketball.
