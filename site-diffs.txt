When it was time for college, I shifted my focus to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science before specializing as a graduate student in system design and application development in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Much of my work these days focuses on technologies that enable users to leverage their personal data for access to new opportunities.

When I am not working, I enjoy singing, writing, lifting, and playing basketball.
