# The Digital Credentials Consortium Website

This repository generates what goes on the https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/ website.

## Structure

The DCC website is a Github Pages site built on Jekyll with Bootstrap as a front-end framework. The pages are built from markdown files using the _layouts/default.html file as a base layout, and referencing a number of additional HTML components that can be found in the _includes folder. The list of pages populating the navigation bar is stored in _data/pagelist.yml.

## Local Development

* Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* In a command line: `jekyll build; jekyll serve`
* Go to `http://localhost:4000/`
